# Admin Backend (Legacy)

This folder was an older local backend.

- Production and localhost now use the Render backend: https://newspulse-backend-real.onrender.com
- Do NOT run `npm run dev` inside `admin-backend` for normal development.
- The real backend repo is `newspulse-backend-real` (deployed on Render).

You may keep this folder for archival reference only.
